# theological-dots-2
My homogenously [color-nostalgia](https://github.com/mitchweaver/color-nostalgia) dotfiles for efficient research &amp; writing in my [theology-wm](https://github.com/historical-theology/theology-wm) build of the suckless project's dwm on Debian, OpenBSD, or another Unix-like OS

My thanks go to [Mitchell Weaver](https://github.com/mitchweaver) and [jcs](https://jcs.org/) for creating the color-nostalgia colorscheme.

More documentation will follow, but I aim to keep this repository more minimalist than my original Theological Dotfiles (1.0).
